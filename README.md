##Observations

Looking at box plot of Final Tumor Volume vs. Drug Regimen, median value of final tumor volume (mm3) is significantly smaller for drug Capomulin and Ramicane compared to Infubinol and Ceftamin. Excluding outlier of Infubinol, both Infubinol and Ceftamin median tumor volume is around 60 mm3 while both Capomulin and Ramicane median tumor volume is 38 mm3. From this boxplot, it is suspected Capomulin and Ramicane are more successful at decreasing tumor size compared to other two drugs.

Looking at Line plot for Tumor volume of mouse I509 for each Timepoint, tumor volume initally increased from day 0 to day 20 even with treatment of Capomulin. However, tumor volume decreased drastically from Day 20 to Dat 45, dropping from 48 mm3 to 41 mm3 in 25 days. From this graph, it shows effectiveness of Capomulin treatment.

Correlation and Regression plot shows that there is strong positive correlation between average tumor volume (mm3) and weight of mice. Correlation is 0.84, which indicates strong positive relationship. From this regression line, I can predict heavier mice will generally have larger tumor volume.
